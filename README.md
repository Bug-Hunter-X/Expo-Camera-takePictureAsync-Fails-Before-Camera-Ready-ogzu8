# Expo Camera takePictureAsync Failure Before Initialization

This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when using the Expo Camera API: calling `takePictureAsync` before the camera is fully initialized.  The provided code showcases the problem and offers a solution to ensure the `takePictureAsync` method is called only after the camera is ready.

## Problem

The original code attempts to take a picture immediately after the component mounts.  If the camera isn't ready, `takePictureAsync` fails silently, leading to unexpected behavior.

## Solution

The solution checks the camera status before calling `takePictureAsync`.  It ensures the camera is ready to capture an image, preventing the error.
